# Update the cache on the main branch on push event
# Support also manual execution
# The cache will be created for release and debug.
#
# The Github action cache is per branch but a branch can access cache for
# it's branch, it's base branch  or the main branche.
#
# Workflow runs cannot restore caches created for child branches or sibling branches.
#
# This workflow make sure to also have a valid cache on the main branch so
# others branch can restore this cache.
#
# * Executing this workflow cancel running execution of this workflow.
